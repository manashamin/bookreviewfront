BookNest – Book Review Management System
Project Overview

BookNest is a full-stack web application designed to manage and display book reviews in a simple, user-friendly, and scalable manner. The main goal of this project is to provide a platform where users can submit reviews for books and view existing reviews, while demonstrating real-world software development practices such as frontend–backend separation, containerization, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployment.

The project follows a modern web application architecture, where the frontend and backend are developed and deployed independently. The frontend is built using React (JavaScript) to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, while the backend is implemented using Spring Boot to expose RESTful APIs that handle business logic and data persistence.

This project was developed not only to meet functional requirements but also to follow industry-level DevOps practices, including Dockerization, GitHub Actions, SonarCloud analysis, and deployment on cloud platforms.

Why BookNest and Why This Architecture

The BookNest application uses React for the frontend because React allows building reusable components, efficient state management, and smooth user interactions without reloading pages. This makes the application faster, more responsive, and easier to maintain compared to traditional multi-page applications.

The frontend and backend are kept completely separate so that:

The frontend can evolve independently without affecting backend logic

The backend can be reused for other clients (mobile apps, future services, etc.)

Deployment and scaling become easier

Real-world enterprise architecture is followed

The backend uses Spring Boot to expose REST APIs that handle review creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion. Communication between frontend and backend happens using HTTP requests, making the system loosely coupled and scalable.

Application Architecture

React frontend sends HTTP requests to Spring Boot REST APIs

Spring Boot backend processes requests and interacts with the database

Docker is used to containerize both frontend and backend applications

The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

Each service is deployed independently on cloud platforms

This architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and real-world applicability.
